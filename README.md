# The Sorting Hat 
***
## Overview 

Welcome to The Sorting Hat, a Harry Potter-themed quiz to determine which Hogwarts House you will be in for the upcoming school term! In the Harry Potter series, the Sorting Hat is a hat that new students to Hogwarts put on and it determines which of the four Houses in Hogwarts (Gryffindor, Huffelpuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin) the student is best suited to based on their personality and characteristics. This is a purely for fun quiz for Harry Potter fans to simulate the experience of wearing the Sorting Hat from the books. 

This site has been created purely for demonstrating Python skills learned as part of the Code Institute's Diploma in Full Stack Software Development. No copyright infringement is intended.

## Concept and Planning 

### UX

- __Target Audience__

   - Individuals passionate about the Harry Potter.
   - Children and adults looking to play a free fun online game.
   - Parents/grandparents looking for an entertaining game for their children/grandchildren to play.

- __User Stories__

   - As a user, I want a free fun online game to play.
   - As a user, I want to be able to easily navigate my way through the game.
   - As a user, I want to be able to personalise my experience of the game.
   - As a user, I want to be able to dictate the length of time I play.
   - As a user, I want to see my final House and have a conclusion to the game.

- __Site Aims__
 
  - The site aims to meet the above user requirements through the following: 
    -  Providing a free, online, fun game to meet the target audience requirements.  
    -  Providing an easy and intuitive way to start, navigate and end or exit the game. 
    -  Enabling the user to personalise their game experience by submitting their name, age and country. 
    -  Enabling the user to play the game multiple times or to exit the game if they wish. 
    -  Providing a game conclusion and final house determination and details of fellow housemates for the upcoming term. 

## UX

### Wireframes

As this is a command line based quiz with a static background, I did not create wireframes for the site.

### Background Styling
- To add some aesthetics to the site and improve UX, I added a Harry Potter themed background-image. This image was selected from [The Wizarding World of Harry Potter](https://www.wizardingworld.com/features/try-out-our-new-harry-potter-video-call-backgrounds).
- I also used [Image Color Picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/en) to identify a color from another Harry Potter image on the same site to use as the basis for the styling of the button.

## Existing Features 

### Game Landing Page

__Favicon__

  -  A image of the Sorting Hat has been added as a favicon for the page. 
  
  ![Favicon](./docs/favicon.png)

__Logo__

  - The initial load of the page is comprised of a logo of the Harry Potter initials in the Harry Potter font generated in ASCII. 
  - [ASCII-Generator](https://ascii-generator.site/) was used to convert images to ASCII for inclusion in the page. 
  - The [Colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) module has been used to color this logo text for improved aesthetics. 
  - There is a sleep delay applied to this page for 5 seconds before the display is cleared and inputs requested from the user. 

  ![Logo](./docs/landing-page.png)

### User Inputs

  - I deliberately decided not to give any information about the game prior to asking for user inputs to maintain a level of secrecy and mystique to the application. 
  - The user is requested to input their name, age and country prior to proceeding. 
  - Name and country inputs are validated to ensure they are not blank and are not soley numerical.
  - Age inputs are validated to ensure they are not blank, are numerical and are between the school-going ages of 4 and 18!
  - These inputs are pushed into a student object for use throughout the game. 

  ![Name Validation](./docs/name-validations.png)
  ![Age Validation](./docs/age-validation.png)
  ![Country Validation](./docs/country-validation.png)

   - Once the user has inputted valid inputs, the computer takes these details to "validate" that the student is magical and not a Muggle!
   - A delay has been added to help create this illusion that background checks are being performed on the users information. 

  ![Muggle Validation](./docs/country-validation.png)

### Welcome Page

  - Once the users non--muggle status has been confirmed they are brought to a new console view welcoming them to Hogwarts. 
  - Again, both the ASCII Generator and Colorama module have been utilised to create a yellow lightning bolt image above the welcome text. 
  - The datetime module has been utilised to get the current year so that this will update to the current year whenever the game is being played.  
  
![Welcome Page](./docs/welcome-page.png)

  - The user is then asked if they want to get started or if they wish to remove the Sorting Hat i.e. quit.
  - The answer input must by y or n and validations are in place to ensure no blank entry or other character is accepted. 

![Start Sorting](./docs/start-sorting.png)

  - If the user enters n they see the follow message and are then brought back to the landing page view. 

![Remove Sorting Hat](./docs/hat-remove.png)

### Questions

  - When the user has decided to proceed, they are brought through a series of 11 questions with 4 answer options. 
  - Each question is displayed with a small delay before the answer options are displayed.  
  - After each question the console display is cleared again to improve UX. 

![Question View](./docs/question-display.png)

  - Again, validations are in place to ensure the user enters a,b,c or d as their answer or alternatively opts to quit the game. 

![Answer Validation](./docs/answer-validation.png)
![Exit](./docs/quit.png)

  - Once an answer has been entered, the next question appears. No feedback is provided on the answer as the quiz is not a right or wrong quiz. 
  - Answers are pushed to an answers list for use in subsequently determining the correct House for the user. 

### House Determination

  - Once all questions have been answered the statistics module imported is used to calculate the mode of the answer list. 
  - Each answer is a question corresponds to a House so the mode maps to which House the user should be placed. 
  - The console then clears to display the initial logo of the House determined for the user in the House colors. 
  - Again, ASCII Generator and Colorama have been used to create these colored logos. 

![Gryffindor Logo](./docs/gryffindor-logo.png)
![Slytherin Logo](./docs/slytherin-logo.png)
![Hufflepuff Logo](./docs/hufflepuff-logo.png)
![Ravenclaw Logo](./docs/ravenclaw-logo.png)

  - The user is then told a bit about the typical characteristics of students in their House.  

![Gryffindor About](./docs/gryffindor-about.png)
![Slytherin About](./docs/slytherin-about.png)
![Hufflepuff About](./docs/hufflepuff-about.png)
![Ravenclaw About](.docs/ravenclaw-about.png)

  - At this point, the user has three options; to enter h to accept their designated House, to press r to re-sort them into a new house or to press q to quit the game and return to the landing page. 
  - If the user selects r, they are brought back to the first question of the loop to run through and provide new answers. 
  - If the user selects q, the quit message is again displayed for the user and they are brought back to the starting landing page. 
  - If the user selects h, their final student details including determined house are pushed to a Google spreadsheet and they are brought to the concluding view and shown a list of housemates that will be in their year.
  - This list is pulled from Google sheets using an API and extracts entries where the House matches that of the user.
  - The tabulate module has been imported and used to display the housemates in a tabular structure. 

![Google Sheet](./docs/google-sheet.png)
![Housemates](./docs/housemates.png)

  - This final view is also time delayed to display for 7 seconds before the console clears and the landing page is displayed again.

### Fixed Bugs   
  - The following key bugs arose and were fixed during the development of the game: 

Bug
Getting subset of spreadsheet to show housemates
Convert back to list of dictionaries
Use list comprehension 
https://www.i2tutorials.com/convert-list-of-lists-to-list-of-dictionaries/
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63508906/get-all-keys-with-specific-value-in-dictionary-python
Looked at using pandas module


    1. Question loop breaking: 
          - Issue: Originally, I had the following code to run through the question loop: 
          '''def generate_questions(): # only gave one/two questions then stopped - had to remove return answers
                      """
                      Runs through sorting hat questions
                      """
                      clear_display()
                      answers = []
                      for q in questions:  
                          print(q['question'])
                          sleep(1)
                          for i, c in enumerate(q['options']):
                              print(chr(97 + i)+ ':', c)
                              
                          while True: 
                              answer = input("Enter your answer:\n>>> ".center(70))
                      
                              if validate_answer(answer):
                                  print('\n\nThank you'.center(70))
                                  answers.append(answer)
                                  break

                          sleep(1)
                          clear_display()

                          return answers''' 
              However, in testing I noticed that the questions would stop after two questions and not complete the loop.  
          - Solution: After some trial and error, I realised that in removing the return answers at the end of the code block the full loop would run. 
          - Resource: Self-resolved. 

    2. Questions looping twice:
          - Issue: As part of testing, I noticed that the questions were looping through twice. 
          - Solution: After reiviewing my code, I realised I was calling the function twice, once from within the preceding function and then again within the main function. Once removed from the main function this issue was resolved.
          - Resource: Self-resolved. 

    3. Text not centering:  
          - Issue: I noticed that on some lines the text was not centering which I had wanted to implement to improve aesthetics and UX.  
          - Solution: Again after some trial and error I noticed that the text would not center where /n had been used to create a line break. After restructuring the print statements I was able to get the centering to work for all statements I wanted centered. 
          - Resource: Self-resolved. 
    
    4. Updating the House for re-sorting:
          - Issue: Initially, I was pushing the various student inputs and House to the Google spreadsheet after the first round of questions with option to re-sort. I was then struggling to find a suitable way to update the House for a re-sort and ensure that the update was for the correct student. 
          - Solution: After a lot of trial and error with functions I concluded on a simpler solution and moved the update spreadsheet function to the end after the user had confirmed that they were happy with the House determination. It is now only at this stage that student details are pushed to the Google sheet which also means that if a user quits the game their details are not stored and do not need to be identified and deleted from the sheet. T
          - Resource: Self-resolved. 

    5. Generation of Housemates table: 
          - Issue: For a while, I was struggling with how to generate a subset of the Google spreadsheet based on House in order to generate the Housemates table for the user. 
          - Solution: After some research, I looked at trying to use the pandas module but then found that if I extracted all data and converted back from a list to a list of dictionaries and then used list comprehension I could then pull the information where the House key had a specific value and push this into a new dataset as the basis for the table. 
          - Resources: [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63508906/get-all-keys-with-specific-value-in-dictionary-python)
                       [i2Tutorials](https://www.i2tutorials.com/convert-list-of-lists-to-list-of-dictionaries/)

### Unfixed Bugs
- The two bugs that remain unfixed are: 

  - 1) Allows input before question finished: Currently the game allows the user to enter input prior to being requested. I tried to implement code to block this and only allow a specified window for the user to enter input into the terminal but was unable to find a workable solution to date. Initial research on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29289945/how-to-temporarily-disable-keyboard-input-using-python) seemed feasible but I was unable to succesfully import the msvcrt module. I also tried to implement the keyboard module in an attempt to utilise the wait and send functions to achieve this affect but was unable to import this module either without installing as sudo which based on some research has potential wider implications. On this basis I preceded without implementing this functionality. 

   - 2) Validation limitation: Currently the validation functions for name and country inputs will accept a name that is a mix of both letters and numbers. I had changed this function from using the isnumeric function to the isalpha function which ensured only letters were accepted however I then noticed that this would not accept an entry with a space so for example if somebody entered their first and last name or a country with two words e.g. South Africa. Of the two options I felt not allowing this would be a more frustrating experience for the user and reverted to using isnumeric as the basis for a validation check.
