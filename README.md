Bug
Questions were looping twice - was calling fucntion from within sort function and then again in main
Was breaking after two questions - 

Bug 
Was updating spreadsheet after welcome moved to after generate questions to update with all details (name etc plus house)
Moved house determination within function to be able to access house variable

Bug 
Centering text on line - not centring when using \n on line so included blank lines before instead of line breaks to ensure centring worked.

Bug
Initially pushing inputs and house to spreadsheet after first round of questions with option to re-sort. Trying to update house after re-sorting but changed to push details to spreadsheet once 'student' confirmed happy with house.
